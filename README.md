## Introduction
My name is Kian Gormley, I am a student at General Assembly and aspiring computer programmer.  Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game, if you can enjoy a bug-free experience then I have done my job well.

## Game
I can't think of a game with simpler rules!  Player One is 'X', Player Two is 'O', the first player to get three in a row wins.
